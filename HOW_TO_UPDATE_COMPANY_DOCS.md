## üÜò Troubleshooting

1. Make sure you rebuilt: `npm run build`
2. Make sure you restarted: `pm2 restart webapp`

- Common mistakes:
  - Missing comma between entries
  - Missing closing bracket `}`
  - Unescaped quotes inside strings (use `\"`)

### How to verify it's working?
1. Open dashboard settings
2. Click "View Knowledge Base"
3. Your new policies should appear
4. Document count should be updated

4. **Test after changes:** Always verify AI is referencing your updates
5. **Version your policies:** Include dates in titles/content for tracking
