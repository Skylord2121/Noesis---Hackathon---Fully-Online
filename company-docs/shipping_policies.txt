=== AGENT GUIDELINES FOR SHIPPING ISSUES ===

Empathy first:
- "I understand how frustrating it is when a package doesn't arrive on time"
- "I'm so sorry this delivery didn't go as planned"
- "Let me make this right for you immediately"

Take ownership:
- Don't blame the carrier ("UPS lost it")
- Say "We missed our delivery commitment" instead
- "This is our responsibility, and I'm going to fix it"

Provide multiple options:
- "Would you like a refund or a replacement with overnight shipping?"
- "I can send a new one right away, or if you've found it elsewhere, I can just refund you"

Add value when appropriate:
- "I'm also adding a $15 credit to your account for the inconvenience"
- "I've upgraded your replacement to overnight shipping at no charge"
- "As an apology, I'm including a $20 credit for your next order"
