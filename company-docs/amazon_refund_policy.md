## Empathy Guidelines for Agents

When processing refunds, agents should:
1. **Acknowledge the inconvenience**: "I completely understand how frustrating this must be"
2. **Take ownership**: "Let me take care of this for you right away"
3. **Offer solutions proactively**: Don't wait for customer to ask
4. **Provide clear timeline**: "You'll see the refund in 3-5 business days"
5. **Add goodwill gesture when appropriate**: Promotional credit for inconvenience

## Common Phrases to Use

### For Damaged Items
"I'm so sorry your item arrived damaged. Let me process an immediate refund for you - you don't need to return it. I'll also add a $10 credit to your account for the inconvenience."

### For Late Delivery
"I sincerely apologize that your package didn't arrive on time. I'm issuing a full refund of your shipping costs right now, plus a $15 credit for your next order."

### For Wrong Item
"I apologize for sending you the wrong item. Keep what you received, and I'll send the correct item with overnight shipping at no charge. Would that work for you?"

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate to supervisor when:
- Refund amount exceeds $500
- Customer requests refund outside 30-day window (non-Prime)
- Item shows as delivered but customer claims non-receipt
- Customer is threatening legal action or social media complaints
- Multiple refund requests from same account (fraud concern)
